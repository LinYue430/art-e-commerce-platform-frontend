  'about the artist': 'Toots Zynsky is known for her distinctive “filet de verre” technique that fuses threads of glass to achieve unmatched explorations of color. A process that involved teams of people pulling thread was simplified by her co-invention of a thread-pulling machine, which uses electronic software to create glass thread in a manner comparable to glass optical fiber. While completing her BFA at the Rhode Island School of Design, Zynsky helped found the Pilchuck Glass School, which ultimately made studio glass a mainstream phenomenon. Although her work is constantly evolving, Zynsky consistently experiments with color and form; in her early vessels, Zynsky fused glass with barbed wire and later, nets of glass with blown forms.',
  'about the gallery': 'Since 1973 Heller Gallery has been recognized for playing a seminal role in promoting contemporary sculpture employing glass as its touch stone medium. For more than four decades Heller has exhibited the premier international artists who incorporate glass in their practice and has been a valuable resource for artists, museums, and collectors worldwide.The artists who exhibit at Heller work in a broad range of styles and techniques and explore subject matter equally diverse. Some take on the material itself, testing its limits in monumental sculptures or exploring its fundamental qualities in works that play with the interactions of color, light, transparency and form. Others delve into emotion and myth or comment on art history and do so by casting figurative sculptures, painting on glass, or creating complex large scale installations.'

  'about the work': 'This piece was inspired by natural formations and their textures. Olga used PLIKE Neenah black paper for this piece. PLIKE is one-of-kind "plastic-like" surface which provides a tactile sensation and artistic innovation. Olga explores the different variations that are possible in the composition and plays with the shapes and depth. The beveled edge of black paper was painted with the gold leafing paint. Olga gives the depth to her works by using double-sided sticky foam between the layers. The paper sculpture techniques give the artwork a greater illusion of 3D.',
  'about the artist': 'Making art is the meditation and relaxing process for me. It is a pleasure and a very hard work at the same time. I never know what the finished product is going to be. Instead, I let the cutting be dictated by my imagination, feelings, and ideas. The distinguishing feature is the paper edge that’s hand-cut at an angle with razor blade, as this creates smoother transitions from light to shadow. I give depth to my work by using double-sided sticky foam between the layers. The paper sculpture techniques give the artwork a greater illusion of 3D. All my sculptures are created by inspiration of nature’s fascinating beauty. I like natural formation and their textures. Even a small rock, piece of wood or bark, shape of cliffs and caves, National Parks, beautiful landscapes, or sunset can inspire me for my new project.',

  'about the artist':'Preoccupied with the extremes of religious experience and its psychological origins, Joshua Hagler works in mixed media, impasto oil painting, and digital animation to explore evangelism, Christian mysticism, and prophecy. In his twisted images Hagler integrates his Middle American upbringing with an exploration of obscure Italian religious art and its various techniques and traditions. Often the sheer density of media in a single work distorts his imagery, creating a grotesque and haunting effect. Hagler also works in installation, photography, and sculpture. For a 2012 solo exhibition, “The Imagined Chase”, he interviewed four men with uncommon religious perspectives. From these interviews or “confessions”, he created mixed-media paintings, sculptures, and digital 3-D videos, including a projection room in which the testimonies of all four men played in a continuously looped 3-D animation.',
